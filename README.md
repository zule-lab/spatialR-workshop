# Ziter Urban Landscape Ecology Lab: SpatialR Workshop
Author: Isabella Richmond   

The goal of this workshop is to familiarize the ZULE lab with knowledge regarding packages, basic analyses, and mapping strategies that we can use to clean, analyze, and visualize spatial data within R. 

The slides can be found [here]( zule-lab.github.io/spatialR-workshop/). The workthrough of examples including data, code, and outputs can be found in the `example/` folder.     

Dependencies for this workshop include `tidyverse`, `sf`, `stars`, `mapview`, and `osmdata`.
