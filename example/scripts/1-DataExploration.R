# Packages --------------------------------------------------
# all packages should already be installed, we just need to load them
p <- c("sf", "terra", "mapview")
lapply(p, library, character.only=T)

# Data ------------------------------------------------------
# let's load in the Ruelles Vertes data that can be found at https://donnees.montreal.ca/ville-de-montreal/ruelles-vertes
# this is vector data so we will use sf
# shapefile containing the polygons for 935 ruelles vertes across Montreal
rv <- read_sf("input/ruelles-vertes.shp")

# okay, now let's load in some canopy cover data 
# this is raster data, so we will use stars 
# tif file containing pixels of land cover type across Montreal
cc <- read_stars("input/canopy-cover.tif")

# Data Investigation/Cleaning --------------------------------
# let's look at the attributes of our ruelles vertes data 
head(rv)
# there is some very important information in this data summary 
# notably - CRS, data attributes, and geometry column

cc
# rasters look very different than vectors when investigating them 
# there are important things to note here as well 
# stars object info is often easier to understand if we extract it with sf functions
st_crs(cc)
# this looks like a lot but what is important is that the EPSG (9001)
# is different from the EPSG number in rv - these datasets are projected differently

# let's reproject so that these match 
# rasters take a long time to reproject
# for simplicity, let's match rv to cc 
# if you wanted to transform the raster, you would use function terra::project()
rv <- st_transform(rv, crs=st_crs(cc))

# Visual Investigation --------------------------------------
# really important to visually inspect spatial data - that is the easiest way to find issues 
# investigate ruelles first 
mapview(rv)
# then canopy cover
mapview(cc)
# then together 
mapview(rv) + cc

# Save ------------------------------------------------------
# cool! everything looks okay so far. Let's save our transformed vector layer and move on 
saveRDS(rv, "input/cleaned/ruelles-vertes-transformed.rds")
