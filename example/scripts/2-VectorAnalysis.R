# Packages --------------------------------------------------
# all packages should already be installed, we just need to load them
p <- c("sf", "dplyr", "mapview")

# Data ------------------------------------------------------
# let's load in our vector ruelles vertes data 
rv <- readRDS("input/cleaned/ruelles-vertes-transformed.rds")

# Analysis --------------------------------------------------
# MERGE 
# when initially investigating data, we saw that ruelles had multiple polygons even when they had the same ID 
# let's merge all polygons with the same ID so that we aren't doing multiple calculations for one alley 
rv_m <- rv |>
  dplyr::group_by(RUELLE_ID) |>
  dplyr::summarise(geometry = st_union(geometry), 
                   nhood = first(PROPRIETAI),
                   codenhood = first(CODE_ARR),
                   date = first(DATE_AMENA))

# AREA 
# let's do some common spatial operations
# let's calculate the area of each ruelles vertes 
rv_m$area <- st_area(rv_m) 
class(rv_m$area) # this function returns a vector of class "units" 
# if we want to use this info in future operations - we need to convert from units to double
rv_m$area <- as.double(rv_m$area)

# BUFFER
# let's calculate a buffer around each ruelle so we can extract canopy cover 
buff <- st_buffer(rv_m, 50) # important note: our projection is in m so the number we use here is m 
# let's visualize the buffers just to make sure everything looks good 
mapview(rv_m, col.regions="red") + mapview(buff) # they look good! 

# SAMPLE 
# sometimes we want to randomly (or very not randomly) sample areas for fieldwork 
# we can use st_sample to generate as many points as we want in our areas of interest 
samp <- st_sample(rv_m, c(3,3), type = "random", by_polygon = F)
samp <- st_as_sf(samp)
# let's visualize, to check 
mapview(rv_m, col.regions = "red") + mapview(samp) # looks great! 
# these sampling points aren't very useful for us without the associated RUELLE_ID values... 

# SPATIAL JOIN
# let's use st_intersects to join the information from the ruelles to the sampling points
samp <- st_join(samp, rv_m, join = st_intersects)

# Save ------------------------------------------------------
# save buffers as intermediate for 3-RasterAnalysis.R
saveRDS(buff, "input/cleaned/buffers.rds")
